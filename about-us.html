              <h2>More Than Just A Charity Organization!!!</h2>
              <p>
                Team Iftar is a notable charity organization that has been mostly recognized for its intevention in providing Street Iftaar during the Holy month of Ramadan.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not just limited to that, Team Iftar have ventured into more charitable deeds since its inception. Commencing its first activity during the month of Ramadan in 2016, Team Iftar have been consistently providing Iftaar for the people in the streets. These people include those who close from work and unfortunately for them the time to break their fast finds them on their journey back home. During this time, the poor cannot be noticed from the rich nor is the fasting person noticed from the non-fasting person. Atleast 250 people are provided with Iftaar daily for all the 29-30 days of the Ramadan. 
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the primary focus of the Organization is to provide food for the destitute. With the situation of some very poor families residing in the Kombos being a motivation to Team Iftar, we made it a duty upon us to provide family packages to some of those families during the month of Ramadan. Notwithstanding, donors have also tasked themselves with entrusting Team Iftar to distribute their donations to needy families outside the month of Ramadan. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Team Iftar have helped in the organization of Medical Assitance to a few individuals who needed emergency medical treatment overseas. The most recent of these being that of Ebrima Ndong, who requires overseas surgery on his spine which was caused by an accident he went through in 2009 <strong><a href="https://gofund.me/9c792d50">(Click to Donate).</a></strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Team Iftar is a non-profit-making Organization which relies on donations provided by donors in order to reach its aims and objectives. Donors can specify their interest and we do our level best to help them achieve their purpose. The volunteers of the organization believe that they will be rewarded by Allah and they do not seek any monetary gain in trying to fulfill the projects. Although Team Iftar, unlike other charitable organization, follows strictly the Islamic principles that conform with the Qur'an and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family).
